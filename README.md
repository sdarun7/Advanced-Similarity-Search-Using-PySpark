# Advanced-Similarity-Search-Using-PySpark
This PySpark-based repository implements similarity search on large datasets, combining text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, TF-IDF) and numerical data normalization. It features multiple similarity algorithms (Cosine, Jaccard, Euclidean, etc.) with performance optimizations and comparison visualizations.
